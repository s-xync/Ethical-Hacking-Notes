### Foot Printing
Done using **nmap** graphically available as **zenmap**  
Before doing foot printing, cover tracks using macchanger and also proxychains and tor services  
**DNS traffic generally runs through port 53**  
[Scanme Nmap](scanme.nmap.org/) for free scanning  
`nmap -oG` --> greppable output  
`nmap -iL` --> input from list  
`nmap -p` --> port  
`nmap -v` --> verbose  
`nmap -vv` --> double verbose

nslookup gives ip address and viceversa.  

`nslookup <ip address> | <hostname>`
